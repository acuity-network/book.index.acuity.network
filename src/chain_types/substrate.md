# Substrate Indexer Architecture

Development was originally funded by 2 grants ([1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/hybrid.md), [2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/hybrid2.md)) from the [Web3 Foundation](https://grants.web3.foundation/).

Substrate is the framework for building chains in the Polkadot ecosystem. Each Substrate chain has an event schema that changes over time. For this reason it is necessary for each chain family to have built its own Hybrid indexer that is kept current with chain runtimes.

When building a Hybrid event indexer for Substrate chains, the Rust library Hybrid Substrate is used to do most of the heavy lifting. Currently, it only supports a single schema per chain. Therefore, once the schema is updated indexing older blocks may result in missing events. This will be resolved in a future version of Hybrid Substrate.

For example, to index Polkadot blockchains (Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, Rococo) Hybrid Polkadot is used. Indexers for all Substrate need to be built, maintained and hosted.

## Indexed Keys

Hybrid Substrate has support for indexing the keys that are built-into Substrate: `AccountId`, `AccountIndex`, `BountyIndex`, `EraIndex`, `MessageId`, `PoolId`, `PreimageHash`, `ProposalHash`, `ProposalIndex`, `RefIndex`, `RegistrarIndex`, `SessionIndex`, `TipHash`.

Indexers can register additional keys to be indexed.

## Indexed Pallets

Hybrid Substrate has support for indexing all the pallets that are built-into Substrate. Indexers can write macros to index additional pallets.

## Event Variant Indexing

In addition to indexing keys, Hybrid can index event variants. This means that the index can be queried for occurrences of a specific type of event. This entails an additional database row for every event and therefore uses more storage space than any of the key indexes.

An indexer will typically expose this option via command line option.

## Queue Depth

In order to maximize the rate of block indexing, Hybrid Substrate will request multiple blocks simultaneously according to the queue depth parameter.

Currently, this only applies when indexing old blocks. Head blocks are indexed one-at-a-time. When indexing a fully synced node this is fine because head blocks arrive slowly. But when indexing a syncing node the head blocks arrive too quickly and the indexer falls behind. A future release of Hybrid Substrate will index old and head blocks using the queue.

## Example Output

Here is example output from Hybrid Polkadot indexing the Westend blockchain:

Hybrid Substrate needs to connect to a full node with `--state-pruning` set to `archive-canonical` or `archive`. Typically, it is necessary to index a node that you control. This is because the indexer will require the node to consume resources far beyond what a public RPC endpoint is prepared to provide.
